# Create-Report 
Reports should be generated by Head TA's to be distributed to TA's. This way, only one person needs to know how to use this software.   

A report contains all students test results and code (syntax highlighted) in a easy to use html packet. 

## Report Folder Structure
```verbatim
report
| -- index.html (Contains student list)
| -- tests.html (Contains all tests with syntax highlighting, will be iframed into all student java files)
|
| -- students/
|     | -- $(student_name)
|                 | -- $(filename).java
|                 | -- pom.xml
|
| -- styles/
```

## Student Page
- Top left: Main button
- Top: File full name
- Left: File hierarchy + Links
- Middle Code for current file
- Right: Tests + tests failed
- Bottom: Next student, previous student

# .darwin folder structure
```verbatim
.darwin
| -- main/ (For patching)  
|     | -- pom.xml  
|     | -- $(student classes eg. java/cs131/sequentialcommandbuilder.java)  
|
| -- test/ (For symlinking into project)
|  
| -- submission_diffs/  
|     | -- ${student_name}  
|  
| -- results/  
|     | -- ${student_name}_{test name}  
|     | -- compile_errors  
|
| -- tests_ran
|  
| -- project(\d+)/  
      | -- src   
      |     | -- main (Patched version. To be compiled)  
      |     | -- test (Symlink to .darwin/test) 
      |  
      | -- pom.xml (Patched version)  
      | -- target (Not persisted between runs)  
```
# Storing Diffs
Goal: Create diff of src/main folder and the pom.xml  
To save space and simplify the project structure, we move each students pom.xml to src/main/ before creating the diff. 

`diff -ruN skel/src/main project/src/main > student.diff`

# Setting active project (Applying diffs)
``` bash
rm -rf .darwin/project/src/main
rm -rf .darwin/project/target
cp -r .darwin/main/ .darwin/project/src/main
patch -d .darwin/project/src/main -p2 < .darwin/submission_diffs/<student_diff>
mv .darwin/project/src/main/pom.xml .darwin/project/pom
```
