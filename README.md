# About 
The head TA is the only person who needs to know how to use this program. This tool will create HTML reports containing students source code (syntax highlighted), and their test results. Distribute these reports to your TA's.

# Installation
https://crates.io/crates/darwin_cli  
`cargo install darwin_cli`  

Ensure your install worked by running `darwin_cli`. This should show the Darwin help message.  

# Quick Use
Download _all student submissions_ zipfile from moodle

Download _project sleleton_. This should have the classic maven project structure:

```vermatim 
skel
| -- pom.xml
| -- src
      | -- main
      |     | -- (main files)
      |
      | -- test
            | -- (test files)
```

Run `darwin_cli grade PROJECT_SKELETON MOODLE_SUBMISSIONS_ZIPFILE`

You will be prompted on which tests to run

Your reports will be in the report/ directory and the plagiarism report will be at plagiarism.html

View each by opening plagiarism.html or report/index.html in chrome.   

Share the reports to your TA's and assign each TA one to grade. 

# Advanced CLI

## 1: Create Darwin Project

Run `darwin_cli create-project PROJECT_SKELETON MOODLE_SUBMISSIONS_ZIPFILE` : Initialize darwin  

This will create a .darwin folder containing copies of all submissions as diffs and the skeleton code. You are free to delete the source and submission folders now.  

## 2: Check for plagiarism
`darwin_cli plagiarism-check dest.html`


## 3: Run tests
Figure out which tests are available using `darwin_cli list-tests`  

Then run a test using `darwin_cli test-all TEST [NUM_THREADS]`. I had the best results using 4 threads.

## 4: Create Report
`darwin_cli create-report DEST-PATH NUM-PARTS [TESTS]`

This will create your report at dest path split into N parts, including test results from the tests listed.

# Stats
## Memory Saving (Using PA1)
- All students submissions Zipped: 75M
- All student submissions Unzipped: 308M
- All student Diffs using autograder: 2MB

__Memory reduction: 99.35%__

## Grading Speed increase

# Create-Report 
Reports should be generated by Head TA's to be distributed to TA's. This way, only one person needs to know how to use this software.   

A report contains all students test results and code (syntax highlighted) in a easy to use html packet. 

## Report Folder Structure
```verbatim
report
| -- index.html (Contains student list)
| -- tests.html (Contains all tests with syntax highlighting, will be iframed into all student java files)
|
| -- students/
|     | -- $(student_name)
|                 | -- $(filename).java
|                 | -- pom.xml
|
| -- styles/
```

## Student Page
- Top left: Main button
- Top: File full name
- Left: File hierarchy + Links
- Middle Code for current file
- Right: Tests + tests failed
- Bottom: Next student, previous student

# .darwin folder structure
```verbatim
.darwin
| -- main/ (For patching)  
|     | -- pom.xml  
|     | -- $(student classes eg. java/cs131/sequentialcommandbuilder.java)  
|
| -- test/ (For symlinking into project)
|  
| -- submission_diffs/  
|     | -- ${student_name}  
|  
| -- results/  
|     | -- ${student_name}_{test name}  
|     | -- compile_errors  
|
| -- tests_ran
|  
| -- project(\d+)/  
      | -- src   
      |     | -- main (Patched version. To be compiled)  
      |     | -- test (Symlink to .darwin/test) 
      |  
      | -- pom.xml (Patched version)  
      | -- target (Not persisted between runs)  
```
# Storing Diffs
Goal: Create diff of src/main folder and the pom.xml  
To save space and simplify the project structure, we move each students pom.xml to src/main/ before creating the diff. 

`diff -ruN skel/src/main project/src/main > student.diff`

# Setting active project (Applying diffs)
``` bash
rm -rf .darwin/project/src/main
rm -rf .darwin/project/target
cp -r .darwin/main/ .darwin/project/src/main
patch -d .darwin/project/src/main -p2 < .darwin/submission_diffs/<student_diff>
mv .darwin/project/src/main/pom.xml .darwin/project/pom
```
