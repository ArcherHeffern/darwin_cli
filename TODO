Diffing
- Create diff of only the src folder
diff -ru skel/src/main project/src/main > student.diff
- Patch to create entire project!
cp skel/src/main main
patch -d ./main -p3 < student.diff



Questions
- Do we need .project? 
- How to compile all classes (not test classes)

.darwin
| -- main/ (For patching)
| -- submission_diffs/
| -- project/
      | -- src (Patched version. To be compiled)
      |     | -- main
      |     | -- test
      |
      | -- pom.xml
      | -- target
             | -- test-classes
             | -- classes (SECTION THATS SWAPPED OUT)

__Planned Features__
Create project
List tests
Run tests (Optionally with range)
Check for plagirism
Show GUI

mvn test-compile
mvn -Dtest=AllSequentialTests surefire:test

__Setup Project__: (skeleton, submissions)
Create .darwin/
Create project/
Copy skeleton/src/main into ./main for patching
Copy skeleton/src/test into ./project/src/test
Compile ./project/src/test into project/target/test-classes
Create all submission diffs at submission_diffs
Copy skeleton/pom.xml into ./project/pom.xml

__Run test__
Delete project/target/classes/
Copy ./main to ./project/src/main
Patch submission_diffs/student.diff into ./project/src/main
Compile main files and move to project/target/classes ( How to do this? )
Run tests
