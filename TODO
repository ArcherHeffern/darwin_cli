__Current__
- Create report to distribute to TA's 

Parse XML file better? 
mvn -Dtest=AllSequentialTests surefire-report:report
Download project better. Should include test dir and src/main instead of project/main

__Later__
- Parsing of result files
  - What if is run multiple times and fails 3/5? 
  - Can we actually parse the result files? 
- Check for plagiarism
- Locate anomolies: Very large diff, long runnings tests
- Summarize results
- Compile error reasoning. 

__Minor__
- Remove all files and directories from project that do not belong
validate create project skel contains pom.xml

__Done__
- Operations that modify state (commands) should be separate from those that retrieve state (queries)
- CQS: command handler (Printing) -> validation -> core logic
- Make parallelizable, project/ 
- Download 
- List all results

# Run in VM's or some other way for security reasons. 
# Make it work for other langauges
## Protocol
Grading skel
| -- src
| -- tests

Student zipfile
| -- src
| -- test (Optional)

## Needs adapters
- extracting config files (eg. pom.xml)
- compile commands
- testing commands
- Reading test files
- Finding test files
- Displaying test results on the frontend

## Make it work for other sources
- Change create project
